This is a Firefox addon which changes the Linux part of your UA string to a Windows 7 one. This will hopefully reduce your browser fingerprintability (see panopticlick.eff.org for example).

## Development

The addon can be built and run using the [addon SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK). You can just use `cfx xpi` to package, and `cfx run` to run in a clean browser profile.
